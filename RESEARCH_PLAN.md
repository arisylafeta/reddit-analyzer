# Reddit Research Plan: Systematic Problem Discovery & Validation

## Overview
This plan implements the systematic approach outlined in the [Founder's Playbook](https://g.co/gemini/share/bdd596a9de77) for discovering startup opportunities through online community analysis, specifically targeting Reddit and other forums.

## Phase 1: Foundation - Problem Discovery Strategy

### 1.1 Target Communities & Subreddits

**High-Value Problem-Hunting Grounds:**

#### A. Technical Communities (High Signal Strength: 5/5)
- **r/sysadmin** - IT infrastructure pain points
- **r/DevOps** - Deployment & scaling issues  
- **r/webdev** - Development workflow problems
- **r/datascience** - MLOps & data pipeline frustrations
- **r/entrepreneur** - Business process inefficiencies

#### B. Business & Sales Communities (High Signal Strength: 4/5)
- **r/sales** - CRM & sales process pain points
- **r/SaaS** - Product development challenges
- **r/marketing** - Marketing automation gaps
- **r/freelance** - Workflow & client management issues
- **r/smallbusiness** - Tool recommendations & pain points

#### C. Niche Professional Communities (High Signal Strength: 4/5)
- **r/accounting** - Financial software limitations
- **r/legaladvice** - Legal workflow inefficiencies
- **r/consulting** - Client management challenges
- **r/projectmanagement** - PM tool frustrations

### 1.2 Problem Signal Keywords

**Pain Signal Indicators:**
```
"frustrating", "broken", "unsolved problem", "alternative to", 
"workflow", "automate", "how do you handle", "tool for",
"struggling with", "nightmare", "time consuming", "manual",
"workaround", "hack", "limitations"
```

**Solution Request Indicators:**
```
"what's your workflow for", "how do you all handle", 
"recommendation for", "best tool for", "looking for",
"anyone know of", "wish there was", "if only"
```

**Urgency Indicators:**
```
"help!", "urgent", "ASAP", "deadline", "emergency",
"production down", "critical", "immediately"
```

## Phase 2: Implementation - API & Database Structure

### 2.1 Subreddit Targeting List

```python
# Primary research targets
SUBREDDITS = {
    'technical': [
        'sysadmin', 'devops', 'webdev', 'programming', 'datascience',
        'MachineLearning', 'docker', 'kubernetes', 'aws', 'python'
    ],
    'business': [
        'sales', 'SaaS', 'marketing', 'entrepreneur', 'startup',
        'freelance', 'smallbusiness', 'consulting', 'projectmanagement'
    ],
    'specialized': [
        'accounting', 'legaladvice', 'medicine', 'education',
        'nonprofit', 'realestate', 'logistics'
    ]
}
```

### 2.2 Search Query Templates

```python
# Pain point discovery queries
PAIN_QUERIES = [
    "alternative to {tool_name}",
    "{tool_name} is frustrating",
    "problems with {tool_name}",
    "limitations of {tool_name}",
    "hate using {tool_name}",
    "why is {process} so difficult",
    "manual {process} taking forever",
    "workflow for {task}"
]

# Solution request queries  
SOLUTION_QUERIES = [
    "best tool for {task}",
    "how do you handle {process}",
    "recommendations for {problem}",
    "automate {task}",
    "streamline {workflow}",
    "looking for {solution_type}"
]

# Opportunity validation queries
VALIDATION_QUERIES = [
    "would pay for {solution}",
    "budget for {tool_category}",
    "ROI of {solution_type}",
    "cost of {current_process}",
    "team struggling with {problem}"
]
```

### 2.3 Database Schema for Research Data

```sql
-- Posts table for raw data
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    subreddit TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    score INTEGER,
    num_comments INTEGER,
    created_utc TIMESTAMP,
    url TEXT,
    search_query TEXT,
    problem_category TEXT,
    sentiment_score REAL,
    pain_level INTEGER, -- 1-5 scale
    solution_requests BOOLEAN,
    INDEX(subreddit, created_utc),
    INDEX(problem_category, pain_level)
);

-- Problem themes from analysis
CREATE TABLE problem_themes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    theme_name TEXT UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    frequency_score INTEGER,
    pain_intensity REAL,
    market_size_estimate TEXT,
    validation_status TEXT -- 'unvalidated', 'researching', 'validated', 'invalidated'
);

-- User personas extracted from posts
CREATE TABLE user_personas (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    persona_name TEXT,
    job_title TEXT,
    industry TEXT,
    pain_points TEXT,
    current_tools TEXT,
    willingness_to_pay TEXT,
    contact_potential BOOLEAN
);
```

## Phase 3: Analysis Framework - The "PEG-UMF" Filter

### 3.1 Problem Evaluation Criteria

For each discovered problem, evaluate against:

**P - Popular**: How many people discuss this?
**E - Expensive**: Current solutions cost time/money?
**G - Growing**: Trend expanding the problem space?
**U - Urgent**: Immediate attention required?
**M - Mandatory**: External forces compelling solution?
**F - Frequent**: Recurring problem, not one-off?

### 3.2 Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

```python
# Sentiment scoring for prioritization
def analyze_post_sentiment(post_content):
    """
    Score posts for emotional intensity around problems
    Returns: {
        'sentiment': 'positive/negative/neutral',
        'emotion_intensity': 0.0-1.0,
        'pain_indicators': ['frustrated', 'hate', 'nightmare'],
        'urgency_score': 0.0-1.0
    }
    """
    pass

# Pattern detection for problem validation
def detect_problem_patterns(posts_list):
    """
    Identify recurring complaints and solution requests
    Returns: {
        'common_problems': [problem_dict],
        'solution_gaps': [gap_description],
        'user_segments': [persona_dict]
    }
    """
    pass
```

## Phase 4: Validation Workflow

### 4.1 Customer Discovery Pipeline

```python
# Track potential interview candidates
CREATE TABLE interview_candidates (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    reddit_username TEXT,
    post_id TEXT,
    problem_described TEXT,
    contact_method TEXT,
    outreach_status TEXT, -- 'identified', 'contacted', 'responded', 'interviewed'
    interview_notes TEXT,
    validation_score INTEGER -- 1-5 based on interview
);
```

### 4.2 Outreach Templates

**Initial Contact Template:**
```
Subject: Question about your comment on r/{subreddit} regarding {problem}

Hi {username},

I came across your comment on r/{subreddit} about the challenges of {specific_problem}. 

I'm a developer exploring this problem space, and your perspective would be incredibly valuable.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute chat to share more about your experience? I'm not selling anything—just trying to understand the problem better.

Best,
{your_name}
```

### 4.3 Interview Question Bank

**Problem Validation Questions:**
- "Can you walk me through your current process for {task}?"
- "What's the most frustrating part about {current_workflow}?"
- "How much time do you spend on {problematic_task} per week?"
- "What have you tried to solve this problem?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix this, what would that look like?"

**Solution Validation Questions:**
- "How do you currently handle {specific_pain_point}?"
- "What tools are you using now and what do you like/dislike?"
- "Have you ever allocated budget to solve this type of problem?"
- "Would this be a 'must-have' or 'nice-to-have' for you?"

## Phase 5: Research Tools Integration

### 5.1 Primary Tools Stack

1. **Reddit Data Collection**: Custom Python script + PRAW
2. **Semantic Search**: Your existing semantic search implementation
3. **Community Analytics**: GummySearch for validation
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER + DistilBERT via HuggingFace
5. **Data Management**: SQLite/PostgreSQL + Notion for workflows
6. **Research Notes**: Obsidian for knowledge management

### 5.2 Automated Research Pipeline

```python
# Daily research automation
def daily_research_pipeline():
    """
    1. Fetch new posts from target subreddits
    2. Run semantic search for problem patterns
    3. Score posts for pain/opportunity levels  
    4. Update database with findings
    5. Generate daily research summary
    6. Flag high-potential leads for manual review
    """
    pass
```

### 5.3 Weekly Analysis Reports

Generate automated reports covering:
- **Problem Frequency Trends**: Which issues are growing/declining
- **New Opportunity Alerts**: Emerging problems worth investigating  
- **Validation Pipeline Status**: Interview progress & findings
- **Hypothesis Updates**: Pivot/persevere recommendations

## Phase 6: Success Metrics & Decision Framework

### 6.1 Research Quality Metrics

- **Signal Strength**: % of posts with genuine pain indicators
- **Response Rate**: Outreach success for interviews
- **Problem Consistency**: How often same issues appear across communities
- **Market Size Indicators**: Engagement levels, community sizes

### 6.2 Pivot vs. Persevere Signals

**Green Flags (Continue Research):**
- High pain scores (4-5/5) across multiple posts
- Users describing expensive workarounds
- Growing discussion volume over time
- Multiple failed solutions mentioned

**Red Flags (Pivot to New Problem):**
- Low engagement on problem discussions
- No evidence of budget/willingness to pay
- Problem seems to be declining
- Existing solutions appear adequate

### 6.3 Validation Completion Criteria

Consider a problem "validated" when you have:
- ✅ 15+ interviews confirming the pain point
- ✅ Evidence of current budget allocated to problem area
- ✅ 3+ failed solution attempts described by users
- ✅ Growing trend data over 6+ months
- ✅ Clear target persona with defined characteristics

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**: Set up automated collection for top 10 subreddits
2. **Short-term (2 weeks)**: Build sentiment analysis pipeline and start pattern detection
3. **Medium-term (1 month)**: Begin customer discovery interviews with highest-signal users
4. **Long-term (3 months)**: Complete validation of top 3 problem hypotheses

This systematic approach transforms the chaotic process of "finding an idea" into a structured research methodology that maximizes your chances of discovering a real, painful problem worth solving.
